# Changelog

Notable changes to KiCad-Master-Lib.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)

This repository had no formal releases through most of its history, so earlier entries are
grouped by dated development era rather than by version.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- **Git LFS.** `.gitattributes` tracked `*.step` and `*.stl` through LFS, but only 14 files
  (22.6 MB) were ever stored that way — `*.stp` and `*.wrl` were not tracked, and neither
  were the vendored 3D models. Any clone without `git-lfs` installed silently received
  132-byte pointer files instead of models, and KiCad reported nothing: the 3D viewer simply
  showed no model.

  The 14 objects have been fetched from LFS storage and committed as ordinary files. At
  22.6 MB, LFS offered no benefit and cost a hard dependency on every clone and CI job.

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- Documentation updated for KiCad 10, the committed library tables, and vendoring.

---

## 2026-07-12

### Changed

- Vendored upstream libraries synced ([#4]):
  - `SparkFun-KiCad-Libraries` `42e5152f` → `2423e36a` (123 commits)
  - `OPL_Kicad_Library` `d3392376` → `b0035c51` (6 commits)

  No board's library resolution changed. Of the footprints in use, only `Standoff` and
  `Jumper_2_NC_Trace` changed, and both retain identical pad geometry.

---

## 2026-07-11 — vendoring and library tables ([#1])

### Added

- `kmlib.fp-lib-table`, `kmlib.sym-lib-table`, `kmlib.design-block-lib-table` — committed
  library tables registering all 51 footprint, 46 symbol and 10 design-block libraries via
  `${KICAD_MASTER_LIB}`. A clean clone now resolves every library without per-machine KiCad
  configuration.
- `scripts/gen_lib_tables.py` — regenerates the tables from what is on disk.
- `scripts/vendor_sync.py` — re-vendors an upstream library via a three-way merge, so local
  modifications survive an upstream sync.
- `scripts/check_drift.py` and a daily `upstream-drift` workflow — opens a tracking issue
  when an upstream moves past its pin. Nothing syncs automatically.
- `vendor.yaml` — manifest of upstream URL, tracked ref, pinned commit and licence for each
  vendored library.
- `KMLib_Connectors:BREAD_Slice_Bus_10Pin` — the BREAD slice-bus connector footprint.

### Changed

- Upstream libraries (SparkFun, Seeed OPL, DigiKey, Arduino) are **vendored** under
  `vendor/` instead of tracked as git submodules.
- Names no longer contain spaces (`Thermal Pad` → `Thermal_Pad`, and similar), since names
  appear verbatim in `lib_id` strings and on command lines.

### Fixed

- `LMD18200TNOPB`: 3D model path pointed outside `3dmodels/IC_THT.3dshapes/`.

---

## 2026-04 — organisation

### Changed

- Org rename: `FEASTorg` → `feastorg`.

---

## 2026-01 — reorganisation

### Changed

- Symbols, footprints and 3D models reorganised into categorised `KMLib_*` libraries.
- Prototyping footprints renamed and grouped.

---

## 2025-04 — 3D models

### Added

- 3D models for KMLib parts, stored via Git LFS (since removed — see [Unreleased]).
- Design blocks (`kmlib-local/blocks/`), migrated from the archived
  `KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs` repository.
- GitHub Pages documentation.

---

## 2024-05 — initial

### Added

- Initial library: FEAST symbols and footprints, with upstream vendor libraries as git
  submodules.
